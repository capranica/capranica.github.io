    <td colspan="2"><p>Francine is well known for her skill at <strong>redefining 
        the voice</strong>. For her, the voice is a versatile instrument which 
        can be reshaped according its purpose: for example, she can sing &#8220;straight&#8221; 
        with the <strong>warmth, range and vibrancy of a great jazz or blues vocalist</strong> 
        and, in a moment, alter her voice to create <strong>pure sounds drawn 
        from nature and life&#8217;s experience</strong>. It is this <strong>special 
        blend of song and sound</strong> which makes Francine's treatment of the 
        voice so unique. </p>
      <p> As a <strong>songwriter</strong> Francine creates <strong>innovative 
        compositions</strong> which are highly colourful, rhythmic pieces linking 
        groove, jazz with free improvisation, using melodies on different languages 
        French Creole and English. </p>
      <p> In her <strong>performances</strong> Francine finds <strong>expression 
        not only through her voice but also through her body</strong> &#8211; 
        every note, every sound has a physical consequence turning each performance 
        into an <strong>aural-visual event</strong>.</p>
      <p> <strong>Nothing is static</strong> with Francine. As life and Nature, 
        each day has a new dawn, and so it is that <strong>each performance</strong> 
        with Francine <strong>is a new experience with a life of its own</strong>.</p></td>
