        This workshop will give you the opportunity to develop personally and 
        creatively. It will encourage you to sing freely in a group and individual 
        situation. You will learn to open up your voice by exploring and experimenting 
        with melodic and free vocal sounds. You will have the chance to expand 
        your vocal possibilities and use your potential, strengthen your voice 
        and project your sound better. You will develop your creativity and spontaneity, 
        discover your hidden sounds and build up self-confidence. Vocal exercises 
        will be accompanied by simple movements - the voice flows and frees up 
        when the whole body is involved. You will find out how singing can be 
        of personal value and nourishment for yourself, as you free your voice 
        and personal expression. </p>
      <p><strong>Who is this workshop for?</strong><br>
        This workshop is suitable for all levels of experience. No experience 
        is necessary, beginners and those lacking in confidence are welcome. </p>
      <p><strong>What do you need to bring?</strong><br>
        Just bring yourself! I will be teaching a song during the day for everyone 
        to sing together. The focus is on group work in this workshop.</p>
      <p>Wear loose and comfortable clothing.</p>
