        <br>
        <strong>Body ~ Voice ~ Emotions</strong> <br>
        I provide a safe and supportive, non-judgemental environment where my 
        students, complete beginners to professional singers, are always encouraged 
        to enjoy their own gift of singing and discover their full potential. 
        I encourage my students to expand their emotional repertoire, engage their 
        heart and their passion for singing, and experience vocal freedom. </p>
      <p>Through my own experience of hearing myself sing and listening to others, 
        I discovered that the real beauty of a sound only emerges when it is sung 
        from the heart. Your voice and emotions are intrinsically linked to who 
        you are. I use voice work for personal as well as creative and artistic 
        growth.</p>
      <p> Often I hear people say that they only sing in their bathroom. What 
        stops us from singing with the same uninhibited freedom we were blessed 
        with as children?</p>
      <p align="center"><strong>My aim is to bring back the freedom, the joy of 
        singing and the feeling of being alive.</strong></p>
      <p> I compare voice work to the rough piece of material that a sculptor 
        has front of him before starting his work. The difference with the voice 
        is that you don&#8217;t see it, only hear it. You have to let the &#8216;raw 
        material&#8217; out in order to gain control. The human voice is trained 
        with the piano but singing is not just hitting the right notes, sounds 
        are an integral part of vocal ability. In a safe environment you can allow 
        yourself to explore your full vocal potential and learn to simultaneously 
        create freedom while maintaining control.</p>
      <p>&#8226; Singing is physical<strong><br>
        &#8220;The sound has two directions ~ I am singing down through my body 
        and then into the space.&#8221;</strong> Patricia BARDI (New York)<br>
        All of your body is your instrument. It is important to nourish the relationship 
        between the voice and body to embody the voice. Movement facilitates body 
        awareness, physical tension release, focus, balance with the thoughts, 
        voice projection and vocal freedom. </p>
      <p>&#8226;<strong> </strong>Singing is emotional<strong><br>
        Reach in ~ Reach out</strong><br>
        Singing is a powerful energy. A unique tool which helps the singer to 
        reach inside their heart and release unexpressed emotions; through vocal 
        sounds, melodies and lyrics. <br>
        On a personal level you can explore your emotions and discover yourself, 
        through working with the voice. On a creative level you will become a 
        more dynamic and expressive singer by using your inner feelings creatively 
        and singing words with true meaning. </p>

      <p><strong>About My Topics</strong><br>
        Inspired by being a teacher and singer working with music, dance, theatre, 
        poetry and my work as a healer, I have created my own personal tools. 
        The main elements are:</p>
      <p><strong>The voice and the body</strong><br>
        <em>Awareness of the importance of the body in voice work</em></p></td>

      <p><strong>About Myself</strong><br>
        I started teaching in the early 1990&#8217;s in response to requests from 
        members of the audience after my concerts. &#8220;How do you sing so beautifully?&#8221; 
        They asked with amazement in their eyes, and so my experiences with teaching 
        people how to sing began. My work expanded as I realised that singing 
        and voice work helps people to feel better in themselves and feel empowered. 
        My combination of voice work and healing developed naturally as singing 
        is instinctively connected to the human soul. I continue to develop my 
        work as I never stop learning about the voice &#8211; the unique tool 
        for the expression of human emotions. <br>
        I have a City &amp; Guilds Certificate in Further Education Teaching from 
        The City Literary Institute in London.</p>
