        Singing starts from within. The aim of the course is to help you to discover 
        your emotions and connect with your heart while singing. Learn to judge 
        your own singing positively and give yourself permission to enjoy the 
        sound of your own voice. Set your voice free as a result. Learn to trust 
        yourself and find the courage to reach a deeper place inside. Fear and 
        worry often get in the way. This course will enable you to ground yourself, 
        relax and breathe effectively. You will find a safe place inside. You 
        will learn to listen, feel and then connect to your feelings and sing 
        your favourite song with true meaning. You will gain the confidence to 
        express your emotions freely through your voice in front of others and 
        learn to trust and be spontaneous. The basis of this workshop is developing 
        the spirit and gift of singing. This is not a technical course, but I 
        will refer to vocal technique as is necessary. </p>
      <p>These are the topics that the course will cover:</p></td>
