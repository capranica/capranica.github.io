        <em>Having a good voice is not enough&#8230; Mean what you sing! </em><br>
        In this workshop you will learn to use your inner feelings creatively 
        and connect to your joy of singing. Learning how to ground yourself and 
        finding a safe place inside will enable you to sing your favourite song 
        to others, express your voice from your heart, and release the emotions 
        pictured by the lyric. Singing a song can be compared to telling a story, 
        you will learn to make the song your own by expressing the lyric with 
        conviction, belief and confidence. </p>
      <p> <strong>Who is it for?</strong><br>
        This workshop is for beginners to professional singers who want to discover 
        the art of putting their emotion into their sound and overcome their fear 
        of connecting to and using emotion. Anyone who wants to learn to be creative 
        and discover their vocal freedom and joy of singing. </p>
      <p><strong>What do you need to bring?</strong><br>
        Choose a song and learn it by heart. Bring a note book, a pen and 2 copies 
        of the lyric. Sheet music is not necessary, songs will be sung unaccompanied.</p>
