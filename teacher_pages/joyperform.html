    <td colspan="4" valign="top"><p>Performance is visual - whatever you do is 
        seen and looked at. You need to look confident, be focused and sound good. 
        We will concentrate on physical awareness and expression. Learn to differentiate 
        body language from movement and experiment on a practical level. The aim 
        of this workshop is to make you aware of what you do with your body whilst 
        on stage (what do you do with your hands, your eyes, your feet and your 
        whole body). Once you are aware of your body language, you can incorporate 
        it and use it in your performance. </p>
      <p>Having a good voice is not enough! You need to make the song yours and 
        touch your audience. Mean what you sing, learn to deliver your message 
        and communicate with <strong>conviction, belief and feelings</strong>. 
        The basis of this workshop is developing the spirit and gift of performance. 
        This is not a technical course, but I will refer to vocal technique as 
        is necessary.</p>
      <p><strong>Who is this workshop for?</strong><br>
        Anyone who is motivated to learn about performance through to semi professional 
        and professional singers who want to improve their performance skills. 
        Some singing experience is required. </p>
      <p><strong>What do you need to bring?</strong><br>
        Bring a song that you know by heart. Be prepared to perform from the first 
        day of the workshop. You are welcome to bring your own backing track or 
        your own instrument if you wish to accompany yourself. Microphones and 
        amplification will be provided. You need to have the sheet music and lyric 
        of the song you want to perform. </p>
      <p>Wear loose and comfortable clothing. </p>
