    <td colspan="4"><p><strong>What is spiritual healing?</strong><br>
        At certain times in our lives we need guidance to fulfil our potential. 
        Healing is the gift of well being. A point of balance in our mind, body 
        and spirit. Healing takes place on a physical, mental, emotional and spiritual 
        level. The healer channels Universal energy thought the hands. He /she 
        can be in contact with or off the body. The healer can&#8217;t guarantee 
        healing. Healing is a process and the client has an active part in the 
        healing. The effect of the healing depends on the client&#8217;s belief 
        and willingness to heal. Healing requires no race, class, sex, or religious 
        or spiritual belief.</p>
      <p><strong>What can you expect from the healing session?</strong><br>
        The first session will last for one hour and 15 minutes which will include 
        time to fill in a confidential registration, giving a brief personal and 
        medical history and reasons for seeking healing. The session starts with 
        a discussion to check how the client feels and again at the end to discuss 
        the healing experience and to make an agreement for further healing sessions 
        if appropriate. There are no set rules to how healing should happen. Everyone&#8217;s 
        life is unique so the way people experience healing is unique to the individual 
        and can vary from one session to another. The client remains fully clothed 
        at all times and will receiving a chair healing (sitting down position) 
        or a couch healing (lying down position). During healing the client might 
        be aware of the energies, feel a tingling, some warmth or cold, have an 
        emotional release, a physical ease, feel energised or they might feel 
        nothing at all. Feeling nothing does not reveal if healing took place, 
        or whether the healing energy was effective. The healer will keep a record 
        of the healing and will make confidential notes after each session. These 
        notes will be available for the client to look at. Follow up sessions 
        will last 1 hour.</p>
      <p><strong>About me</strong><br>
        I started helping others to heal during their voice training by helping 
        them to their build self-confidence and empower themselves. I put my hands 
        on my students while teaching them to sing, to help them to relax or release 
        tension, with amazing results. I went on to train in Shiatsu from 1990 
        - 92 and later trained in healing. I became a fully accredited healer 
        in 2004 with The College of Psychic Studies. I am fully insured and qualified 
        to practice healing and I follow the code of conduct from the Confederation 
        of Healing Organisations based on the accordance with the Code of Conduct 
        and guidance to practitioners issued by the British Complementary Medicine 
        Association.</p>
