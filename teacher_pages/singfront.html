        of others? Do you feel that you are holding back when you sing in front 
        of others? Does your heart race? Do your nerves have control of you? Would 
        you like a supportive environment to learn to feel more at ease when you 
        sing in front of others?</em></p>
      <p> <strong>What is the workshop about?</strong><br>
        The aim of this workshop is to help build self-confidence and self-belief 
        to overcome the barriers that prevent you from singing freely in front 
        of others. Transform your fear or nerves into passion and openness in 
        front of others. Learn to love the sound you make when you sing. Enjoy 
        expressing yourself. Learn to reveal more of your true self while being 
        watched and listened to. You will find out that many others share similar 
        feelings about using their voice. Overcoming your fear teaches you to 
        value yourself and recognise the value that singing can bring to you. 
        Come along and find the support you need. Make your voice heard!</p>
      <p><strong>Who is the workshop for?</strong><br>
        Singing experience is not necessary. This workshop is suitable or anyone 
        with little or no experience right through to semi professional and professional 
        singers. </p>
      <p><strong>What do you need to bring?</strong><br>
        Bring a song you want to sing front of others. Learn the words by heart 
        and the tune as best you can. Sheet music is not needed as singers will 
        sing unaccompanied. You are welcome to bring your own backing track or 
        your own instrument if you wish to accompany yourself.</p>
      <p>Wear loose and comfortable clothing.</p>
