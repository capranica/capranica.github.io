    <td colspan="4" valign="top"> <p>The healing with voice session is a one to 
        one session. It combines singing and <u><a href="healing.html" target="content_th">hands 
        on healing</a></u> in a suitable professional environment. The procedure 
        is not fixed and varies depending on needs, aspirations and what is best 
        for the client. Healing can be given before during and/or after singing. 
        A regular client might receive healing for a whole session and then sing 
        in another session.</p>
      <p><strong>Know your voice - Know yourself</strong><br>
        Singing is connected to who you are. It is a channel to connect to your 
        heart and a way to express your soul through the voice. Singing in itself 
        is healing, it brings a feeling of well being and joy.</p>
      <p><strong>What can the session offer?</strong><br>
        The combination of hands on healing can help to harmonise body, mind, 
        heart and spirit and expression of the soul through singing.</p>
      <p>&#8226; It can help to relax mentally and release physical tension<br>
        &#8226; Free your mind from worry - worrying about your sound and being 
        attached to making a particular sound, will stop your voice from flowing 
        naturally <br>
        &#8226; Our minds get in the way and distract us - the session can help 
        you to ground yourself and bring focus<br>
        &#8226; Find your self-belief and trust<br>
        &#8226; Help you to be less judgmental<br>
        &#8226; Experience being with oneself<br>
        &#8226; Deepen your physical awareness<br>
        &#8226; Experience singing using the body and deeper breathing<br>
        &#8226; Naturally connect to your heart and find the courage to feel emotions 
        and sing from deeper within<br>
        &#8226; Release unexpressed emotions<br>
        &#8226; Expand your range and develop the confidence to overcome fear 
        and reach &#8216;high notes&#8217;<br>
        &#8226; Find your balance and feel stronger within yourself<br>
        &#8226; Value your feelings, therefore value who you are <br>
        &#8226; Handle your emotions better<br>
        &#8226; Enhance your openness to others<br>
        &#8226; Connect with your soul</p>
      <p><strong>What can you expect from a healing with voice session?</strong><br>
        The first session lasts 1 hour and 15 minutes which will include filling 
        in a confidential questionnaire about general health and the reasons why 
        the client is seeking healing with voice. We will always agree on the 
        procedure of the session and it will always start and end with a discussion 
        to check on how the client feels and to discuss their experience of the 
        session. Healing can be received while seated on a chair, standing up 
        or lying down. Healing is given through the hands on or off contact with 
        body, the client remains fully clothed. Follow up sessions last 1 hour.</p>
      <p><strong>What do you need to bring?</strong><br>
        Bring a song to sing and wear loose and comfortable clothing. </p>
      <p><strong>Who is healing with voice for?</strong><br>
        None to all levels of experience are welcome. <br>
        These sessions are for anyone who feels that healing and singing are connected.</p>
